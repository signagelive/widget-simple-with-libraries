# Widget Simple Template with libraries
This is a simple widget template to help you get started which demonstrates how to load and use Widget Preferences as well as the basic file structure of a widget. 

It uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) to help create modular code and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to load the configuration and interact with the DOM

To test this widget in Signagelive:
1. Zip up all of the folders and index.html and config.xml
2. You can call it anything you wish
3. Change the File Extension to .wgt
4. Upload to Signagelive
5. You will note you can change the value of the Text preference to anything you like (in the Media Asset properties)
6. Publish to your Signagelive Player
7. Your message will display on your screen
